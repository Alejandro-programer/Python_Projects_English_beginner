## 🚀 About the Repository
This repository contains a collection of **13 Python scripts** developed during my learning journey. Every project was originally written in Portuguese and has been fully translated into **English** to follow international coding standards. 

### 🛠️ Key Transformations:
* **Language:** All variables, comments, and strings translated to English.
* **Currency:** Formatted from **R$** to **US$**.
* **Logic:** Clean and optimized code using modern Python techniques.
